I'm Bryan Andrei, but you can call me Yanrei.

I'm a highly motivated aspiring data analyst. I'm passionate about uncovering the stories hidden within data and am committed to using data to make data-driven decisions and have a meaningful impact. I thrive on the challenge of turning raw data into meaningful insights that inform informed decision-making.

I'm familiar with a range of data analysis tools, including:

* **Databases:** SQL (MS SQL Server)
* **Database Management:** Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
* **Data Visualization:** Excel, Tableau, Power BI

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying dashboard design and UI/UX best practices.
